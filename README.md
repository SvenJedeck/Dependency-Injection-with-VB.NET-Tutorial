### Welcome to EduDependencyInjection
This project is a step by step (self-)educational tutorial about "**Dependency Injection with VB**"

### Please take a look at [Wiki](https://github.com/SvenJedeck/EduDependencyInjection/wiki)

I try to built this up like a teaching book. Every branch represents a chapter/subchapter. The learning philosophy is to understand the theoretical background on the basis of practice.  
The wiki is bilingual; once in English, once in German.

### Inspired 
Strongly inspired by [Obelink's](https://github.com/obelink) clear and well - constructed [Repository Part01](https://github.com/obelink/DependencyInjectionVBPart01) on Dependency Injection. [Part Two about Inversion of control (IoC)](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/vbteam/2017/09/07/dependency-injection-with-visual-basic-net-part-2-ioc-containers/) will be done (if it will) in a seperate project.
